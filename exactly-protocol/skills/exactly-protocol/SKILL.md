# Exactly Protocol Skill

## Overview

Exactly Protocol is a decentralized lending protocol offering fixed-rate, fixed-term lending via maturity-based pools (ERC-4626 FixedRatePool), plus variable-rate floating pools. It is deployed on Optimism (primary, lower gas) and Ethereum Mainnet.

**Key design**: Unlike Aave V3, deposits do NOT automatically count as collateral. You must explicitly call `enter-market` to enable an asset as collateral before borrowing against it.

**Supported chains:**

| Chain | Chain ID |
|-------|----------|
| Optimism | 10 (default) |
| Ethereum Mainnet | 1 |

**Architecture:**
- All reads use `Previewer.exactly(address)` via `eth_call` - single call returns all market data
- All writes require **explicit user confirmation** before submitting via `onchainos wallet contract-call` with ABI-encoded calldata
- Fixed-rate pools: maturity timestamps are fixed weekly intervals set by the protocol
- Floating-rate pools: ERC-4626 standard deposit/withdraw

---

## Do NOT use this skill for

- **Aave, Compound, or other lending protocols** - use their respective skills
- **Cross-chain bridging** - Exactly positions are chain-specific
- **Governance/voting** - no governance functions implemented
- **Native ETH deposits** - use WETH; native ETH routing through MarketETHRouter is not implemented in this version
- **Protocol rewards claiming** - Exactly does not distribute token rewards in the standard `defi collect` pattern

---

## Maturity Timestamp Format

Maturities are fixed Unix timestamps (seconds since epoch) set by the protocol. They align to weekly boundaries (every Thursday UTC). You CANNOT choose arbitrary dates.

**How to get valid maturities:**
1. Run `get-markets --chain 10` to see current market state
2. Run `get-position --chain 10 --from <YOUR_WALLET>` to see available fixed pools with maturity timestamps
3. Pick a maturity from the output (e.g., `1750896000` for a specific Thursday)

Passing an invalid maturity timestamp will cause the contract call to revert.

**Example valid maturity**: `1750896000` (a Thursday UTC timestamp, weekly interval)

## Pre-flight Checks

Before executing any command:
1. **Binary installed**: `exactly-protocol --version` - if not found, install plugin
2. **Wallet connected**: `onchainos wallet status` - confirm logged in
3. **Chain supported**: 10 (Optimism) or 1 (Ethereum Mainnet)
4. **Collateral enabled**: For borrow commands, verify `isCollateral=true` in `get-position` output. If false, run `enter-market` first.

## Important Gotchas and Warnings

### 1. enterMarket is Required Before Borrowing

Unlike Aave V3, Exactly does NOT auto-enable deposited assets as collateral. You MUST call `enter-market` explicitly.

**Check**: Run `get-position` and look for `"isCollateral": false`. If false for any market you want to use as collateral, call:
```
exactly-protocol enter-market --market WETH --chain 10
```
Ask the user to confirm before submitting.

### 2. Fixed-Rate Repay - Do NOT Use Max Amount

When repaying a fixed-rate borrow, pass the exact `positionAssets` from `get-position` (not an inflated amount). If even 1 wei of penalty has accrued since your last read, the contract may revert.

- Use `--amount <positionAssets>` from get-position output
- The command adds a 0.1% buffer to `maxAssets` automatically (safe)

### 3. Early Withdrawal Penalty on Fixed Deposits

Withdrawing a fixed-rate deposit BEFORE its maturity timestamp applies a market-determined discount - you receive FEWER assets than deposited. The penalty depends on current pool utilization.

**Always inform the user of this risk before withdrawing early.** After the maturity timestamp, no penalty applies.

### 4. Floating Repay Uses borrowShares, Not Asset Amount

For floating-rate repay, you need `floatingBorrowShares` from `get-position`, NOT the asset amount. Pass it via `--borrow-shares`:
```
exactly-protocol repay --market USDC --amount 500 --borrow-shares 450000000000000000
```
The `--amount` is used for the ERC-20 approve (asset amount); `--borrow-shares` is the actual repay parameter.

### 5. Floating Withdraw Requires Zero Debt

Withdrawing all floating-rate collateral while outstanding borrows exist will revert (health factor check). Clear all borrows first using `repay`.

### 6. Penalty Fees Accrue After Fixed-Rate Maturity

If a fixed-rate borrow is not repaid by its maturity timestamp, daily penalty fees accrue. The total owed increases each day. Urgently inform the user when `block.timestamp > maturity`.

### 7. Approve + Deposit Must Not Happen in Same Second

There is a 3-second delay enforced between the ERC-20 approve transaction and the deposit/repay call to prevent nonce collision errors.

## Typical User Flows

### Flow 1: Fixed-Rate Deposit (Lend at Fixed Rate)

```
1. get-markets --chain 10              # See available maturities and rates

4. [Ask user to confirm]
5. deposit --market USDC --amount 1000 --maturity <timestamp>  # Execute
```

### Flow 2: Fixed-Rate Borrow (with WETH collateral)

```
1. get-position --from <addr>  # Check isCollateral for WETH
2. enter-market --market WETH  # If isCollateral=false [ask user to confirm]
3. borrow --market USDC --amount 500 --maturity <timestamp> --dry-run  # Preview
4. [Ask user to confirm]
5. borrow --market USDC --amount 500 --maturity <timestamp>  # Execute
```

### Flow 3: Repay Fixed-Rate Borrow

```
1. get-position --from <addr>  # Get maturity timestamp and positionAssets
2. repay --market USDC --amount <positionAssets> --maturity <timestamp> --dry-run  # Preview
3. [Ask user to confirm]
4. repay --market USDC --amount <positionAssets> --maturity <timestamp>  # Execute
```

### Flow 4: Floating-Rate Deposit + Borrow

```
1. deposit --market WETH --amount 1 --dry-run  # Preview floating deposit
2. [Ask user to confirm]
3. deposit --market WETH --amount 1  # Execute
4. enter-market --market WETH  # Enable as collateral [ask user to confirm]
5. borrow --market USDC --amount 500 --dry-run  # Preview floating borrow
6. [Ask user to confirm]
7. borrow --market USDC --amount 500  # Execute
```

## User Confirmation Requirements

**ALWAYS ask the user to confirm before executing any write command** (deposit, borrow, repay, withdraw, enter-market). Show the dry-run output first, then ask:

> "This will [action] [amount] [asset] on Exactly Protocol (chain [id]). Shall I proceed?"

For early withdrawal of fixed deposits, explicitly state the discount penalty amount before asking for confirmation.
