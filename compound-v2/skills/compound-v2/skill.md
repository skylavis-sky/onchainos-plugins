## Architecture

- Read ops (`markets`, `positions`) → direct `eth_call` via public RPC; no wallet needed
- Write ops (`supply`, `redeem`, `claim-comp`) → after user confirmation, submits via `onchainos wallet contract-call --force`
- Dry-run only (`borrow`, `repay`) → always returns preview; never broadcasts

## Commands

### markets — List cToken markets

```bash
compound-v2 [--chain 1] markets
```

Returns supply APR, borrow APR, and exchange rate for each cToken market. Read-only; no wallet needed.

---

### positions — View your positions

```bash
compound-v2 [--chain 1] positions [--wallet 0x...]
```

Returns supplied (cToken balance + underlying equivalent) and borrowed amounts per market. Read-only.

---

### supply — Supply an asset to earn interest

```bash
# Preview (dry-run)
compound-v2 --chain 1 --dry-run supply --asset USDT --amount 0.01

# Execute
compound-v2 --chain 1 supply --asset USDT --amount 0.01 --from 0xYourWallet
```

**Execution flow:**
1. Run with `--dry-run` to preview the steps and calldata
2. **Ask user to confirm** the asset, amount, and that they will receive cTokens in return
3. For ERC20 assets: execute `ERC20.approve(cToken, amount)`, wait 3 seconds, then `cToken.mint(amount)`
4. For ETH: execute `cETH.mint()` as a payable call with ETH value
5. Report approve txHash (ERC20 only), mint txHash, and updated cToken balance

---

### redeem — Redeem cTokens to get back underlying

```bash
# Preview (dry-run)
compound-v2 --chain 1 --dry-run redeem --asset USDT --ctoken-amount 0.5

# Execute
compound-v2 --chain 1 redeem --asset USDT --ctoken-amount 0.5 --from 0xYourWallet
```

**Execution flow:**
1. Run with `--dry-run` to preview
2. **Ask user to confirm** the amount of cTokens to burn and underlying to receive
3. Check cToken balance — fail if insufficient
4. Execute `cToken.redeem(cTokenAmount)`
5. Report txHash and updated cToken balance

---

### borrow — Preview borrowing (DRY-RUN ONLY)

```bash
compound-v2 --chain 1 --dry-run borrow --asset USDT --amount 1.0
```

**Note:** Borrow is dry-run only for safety. Shows the calldata and steps. Requires collateral to be supplied first on Compound V2. Never executes on-chain.

---

### repay — Preview repaying borrow (DRY-RUN ONLY)

```bash
compound-v2 --chain 1 --dry-run repay --asset USDT --amount 1.0
```

**Note:** Repay is dry-run only for safety. Shows approve + repayBorrow steps. Never executes on-chain.

---

### claim-comp — Claim COMP governance rewards

```bash
# Preview (dry-run)
compound-v2 --chain 1 --dry-run claim-comp

# Execute
compound-v2 --chain 1 claim-comp --from 0xYourWallet
```

**Execution flow:**
1. Run with `--dry-run` to preview
2. **Ask user to confirm** before claiming
3. Execute `Comptroller.claimComp(wallet)`
4. Report txHash

---

## Key Concepts

**cTokens represent your supply position**
When you supply assets, you receive cTokens. The exchange rate increases over time as interest accrues. To get your assets back, redeem cTokens.

**Exchange rate**
`underlying = cToken_balance × exchangeRate / 1e18`
The exchange rate starts at ~0.02 and grows monotonically.

**Borrow requires collateral**
To borrow, you must first supply collateral. Each asset has a collateral factor (e.g., 75% for ETH). Your total borrow must not exceed your borrowing capacity.

**COMP rewards**
Compound V2 distributes COMP tokens to suppliers and borrowers. Use `claim-comp` to collect accrued rewards.

## Dry-Run Mode

All write operations support `--dry-run`. In dry-run mode:
- No transactions are broadcast
- Returns expected calldata, steps, and amounts as JSON
- Use to preview before asking for user confirmation

## Error Responses

All commands return structured JSON:
```json
{"ok": false, "error": "human-readable error message"}
```
